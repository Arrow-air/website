# Introduction to Arrow Contracts

To support a large open-source project like Arrow Air, governance and token economics are best managed by [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) thanks to their transparency, immutability, and objectivity.

Currently, we are still developing our contracts. Feel free to check out and/or contribute to our [repository](https://github.com/Arrow-air/Arrow-Contracts).
