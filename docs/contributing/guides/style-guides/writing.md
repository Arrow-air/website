## :muscle: Motivation 
Arrow DAO is an international effort. Although we conduct our business
in English, our stakeholders vary in English fluency and reading
proficiency. Even among native English speakers, confusion and
misunderstandings arise when local idioms or slang are introduced.

In an attention economy, first impressions matter in forming long-term partnerships. The Arrow brand will benefit from consistent writing styles by presenting an accessible, professional, organized and committed front that attracts contributors and business partners. 

## :book: Guidelines 
### :telescope: Scope
The style guide applies to all official and public-facing materials.
 
### :busts_in_silhouette: International Audience
1. Reduce idioms, local slangs.
2. Units of measurement shall be in metric.
3. Timestamps shall be in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and use 24 Hour format (e.g. 14:00 instead of 2:00 PM).

### :wheelchair: Accessibility
Some may access our contents using tools like screen readers. We want to be as inclusive as possible. Keep accessibility in mind when writing contents.

For rich media materials like images, always try to add descriptive alternative titles so that screen readers can parse the materials.

### :white_check_mark: Readability
Readability can be quantitatively measured by the [Flesch-Kincaid score](https://readable.com/readability/flesch-reading-ease-flesch-kincaid-grade-level/).
To reach a broader audience without losing professionalism, we strive to
score at which materials can be understood by 13-to-15-year-olds. 

* If technology allows, take advantage of rich formatting like **bold**, *italic*, <ins>underline</ins>, ordered and unordered lists. We don’t want to throw a wall of text to our readers. 
* Without losing meaning, reduce verbosity as much as possible. 
* Avoid using jargon except for technical documentation.
* Spell out acronyms when first introduced.

## :mag_right: Editorial Review Process
### :page_with_curl: Arrow Blog
1. The blog post submission must be in markdown format.

    1. A Pull Request must be made on the
        [website](https://github.com/Arrow-air/website/) GitHub
        repository. 
    2. The new submission should be automatically broadcasted in Discord, and we do a fit screening. 
    3. If any of the following fails, we stop here and reject the PR.

2. Prior to opening a Pull Request, please confirm the following about the piece:
    * Should not be an op-ed
    * Should not be irrelevant 
    * Should not be identical to existing posts
    * Should not be promotional
    * Should have no spelling/grammar issues.
3. The "Editors" group on GitHub will review the blog.
4. Editors, at this step, are free to make stylistic edits as long as the meaning of the edited part remains unaltered. The goal is to make the writing more “Arrow-like”.
5. Review once again for inclusiveness purposes. Find out and modify wordings that might be too localized or exclusive. (don’t assume that everyone has the same context)
6. If it’s a technical blog, we need to review deeper for fact checks
