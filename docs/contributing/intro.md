# Getting Started

The best way to get connected with the Arrow community and start working is to join our Discord server!

Introduce yourself in the `#introductions` channel and we'll all be happy to get you up to speed - we're a friendly bunch!

:warning: As a general rule of culture, you don't need formal permission to start working on anything. However, it's best to communicate well with the community to keep us all aligned and working on high-impact tasks.

See the [Development Guide](./devguide.md) for contributions our GitHub repositories.

See the [Contributor's Hub](./contributors-hub.mdx) for information on collaboration, compensation, and more.
