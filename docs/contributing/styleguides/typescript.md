# TypeScript Style Guide

:zap: View the sidebar (right) for the rapid navigation.

:exclamation: We follow the [Google TS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html).

## :guardsman: Formatters & Linters

Run [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) prior to pushing code.

:exclamation: ESLint will be run in CI (GitHub Workflows). Linting and formatting errors must be resolved prior merging a pull request.

## :page_with_curl: License Boilerplate

Every file should start with a license boilerplate.

The license may vary from repository to repository.

Check with the `#legal` team if unclear which license to use.
