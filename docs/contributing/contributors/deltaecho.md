## Please involve me!

Each and every entity is connected in a certain way at a certain level. Isolated efforts to complete a piece of puzzle can work, but would possibly be not optimized to the best extent possible to serve its purpose in an efficient way, which is sometimes OK. 

So please involve me when you have to involve someone else other than yourself to complete the piece of puzzle.
