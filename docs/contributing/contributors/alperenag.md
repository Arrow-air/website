## About

📍 Turkey

I love being an engineer, I love engineering projects, I love engineers. That doesn't mean I don't love others.

*Fun fact:* I'd like to build a transatlantic boat and sail to Caribbeans. 

### Team contributions

Project Spearhead & Project Feather aircraft design, structural design, manufacturing, testing efforts.
Project Feather Pod Leader

### Main skills

I'm an aerospace engineer with 7 years of experience in the industry. Plenty of some things and a touch of everything related to aircraft.

## Please involve me!

I've believed in Arrow's mission from the beginning and now we're closer than ever!
