## About

üìç Austin

I am the original founder and general manager of Arrow. I've been in the crypto space for a while and worked as an engineer at a few different startups before Arrow. I'm super optimistic on the future of hardware, built by an open global community.

*Fun fact:* I'm a huge space history nerd, particularly around the Apollo program. I'm hoping to go to space one day.

### Team contributions

* Recruiting the original team
* Project management
* Prototyping

### Main skills

I spend most of my time coordinating with all of the different contributors here and keeping all of our different projects moving towards the same long-term vision. I think a lot about governance and how Arrow can scale in the real world while remaining open and distributed.

## Please involve me!

I'm happy to jump in on anything and everything. I'm a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, with light experience in full stack dev, hardware, and project management. DM me if you want to chat or get more involved with Arrow. It's my personal mission to find a place for everyone here.
