# Contributors Hub

To ensure that you have a smooth contributing experience (and get paid fairly ðŸ˜Š), we created this page to include every technology and documentation we used to establish our workflows and compensation frameworks.

We highly recommend you bookmark this page if you want to be actively involved.

## Collaboration

### [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fab4bxaAW9)
We use Discord to exchange ideas, schedule meetings, and send memes around. Arrow's Discord channel is the best place to keep up with Arrow's development and hang out with other contributors.

### [GitHub](https://github.com/Arrow-air)
Everything we do is open-sourced. Software and hardware engineering works can be found from our repositories. 

### [Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/arrow-air)
Dework is a web3-native collaboration platform that allows for tasks/bounties management. Contributors can sync up their Discord roles to Dework and get compensated. Dework is also a good place to see what people are working on and their progress.

## Compensation

There are multiple ways to get compensated:
* Commitment Track: active contributors will get paid by a combination of Arrow tokens and USDC stable coins. Think of this as the "base salary" of a traditional job. Of course, we provide flexibility on your commitment level. See below for more information.
* Bonus: Each contributor has 1,000 ARROW each month to "tip" other contributors to appreciate their works. This is done in Coordinape (see below).
* Bounties: Complete bounties on Dework will be paid in USDC or ARROW, or a mix of both.


### [Coordinape](https://app.coordinape.com/)
Contributors can see what other contributors are doing/have done in a given month and have 1,000 ARROW tokens to allocate to other contributors to show their appreciation.

### [Sablier](https://app.sablier.finance/)
Contributors admitted to the Commitment Track will be able to receive USDC through Sablier, a web3 product that pays you **per second**. It's super cool!

### Docs
Contributors who are interested in the Commitment Track should monitor Discord for each period's sign-up announcements. Usually, the sign-up is done by filling out a Google Form.
